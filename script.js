Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the 
formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in letiables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean letiable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the letiable from step 3. 
(Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

 John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the
 latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while
 Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

 1. Calculate the average score for each team.
 2. Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), 
 and print the winner to the console. Also include the average
 score in the output.
 3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget
 to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score).

 4. EXTRA: Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97,
 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the
 console. HINT: you will need the && operator to take the decision.
 If you can't solve this one, just watch the solution, it's no problem
 :)
 5. Like before, change the scores to generate different winners,
 keeping in mind there might be draws.

 GOOD LUCK
